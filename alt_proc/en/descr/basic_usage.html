<p>Letâ€™s suppose that you have developed a number of simple Python scripts that do some
useful data processing. For example, the first script requests satellite metadata from
provider by certain parameters. Then other scripts load data, calibrate it, produce RGB
image and download it to the site storage. Each of these scripts is developed separately
and can be easily debugged. Intermediate files that used by several scripts could be
formed during the processing. Everything seems to be working fine manually but the
production needs to be automated. In such cases, alt_processing comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>Two tasks are configured:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Periodic Task</strong> includes a script, that discovers new data and generates the <strong>Event</strong>
for each new satellite scene with its parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Event Task</strong> includes a chain of scripts that process new scene: load, calibrate, form
RGB image, and deliver results.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is important is that only slight modification of existing scripts is needed.
Everything is working the same way it would work during a manual process.</p>

<p>For each <strong>Event</strong> the <strong>Launcher</strong> automatically creates <strong>Processing</strong> as chain of
<strong>Scripts</strong>, makes temporary working directories for the whole <strong>Processing</strong> and each <strong>Script</strong>, 
run <strong>Scripts</strong> in sequence according to available resources, rerun <strong>Script</strong> in the
case of a soft error, delete temporary directories after execution to keep required amount
of free space. User web interface shows the status of <strong>Processings</strong>, gathers statistic of
success and failures, allows to manually rerun certain <strong>Processing</strong> and <strong>Scripts</strong>, pauses
<strong>Tasks</strong> and much more. The same functions could be done via <strong>API</strong> and even from running <strong>Script</strong>
that gives utter control over processing features.</p>

<p><strong>System</strong> starts working but as always something goes wrong sometimes. For example one of the
<strong>Script</strong> fails from time to time and log file does not help much. In this case before
temporary directory is not deleted there is an opportunity to run and debug failed <strong>Script</strong>
in the terminal. This speeds up development and debug process simultaneous with <strong>System</strong>
production exploitation.</p>
